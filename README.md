# Sandeep's Turborepo

This is my mono repo for all my projects. I am using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) to manage my monorepo.

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- 'biowear': My biology clothes ecommerce store
- 'biowear-admin': Admin panel for my biowear ecommerce store
- 'fire-chat': A chat app built with firebase
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by all my applications
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
yarn run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
yarn run dev
```
